## Larus Soaring Flight Information Sensor System

This project provides hardware and software to create a sensor system for glider Flight-Management-Systems like XCsoar.

* Sensor hardware containing an IMU, pressure sensors and a (D-)GNSS

* Sensor firmware providing information for glider navigation like position, attitude, variometer, real-time wind measurement etc.

* Software-In-The-Loop (SIL)-Simulator to test and qualify algorithms 

* Experimental additional sensors like Angle-Of-Attack or meteorological data
