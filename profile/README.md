### Larus Flight Information Data System for Gliders ###

This project provides hardware and software to create a **Data-Acquisition and Presentation System** for **Gliders** including data output to **Flight Management Systems** like [XCsoar](https://github.com/XCSoar).

### Overview
- The documentation starting point is here: https://github.com/larus-breeze/doc_larus

### Frontend - Coming Soon
- 57mm display unit. With transflective 2" display or a round 2.1" Display, STM32H7 and Rust firmware.

### Sensor

Sensor hardware containing an **IMU**, **pressure sensors** and a **(D-)GNSS**
The sensor firmware is providing essential information for glider navigation like

  - **Position (Precision GNSS)**,
  - **AHRS** = Attitude including true heading, optionally with D-GNSS satellite-based heading
  - GNSS/INS-based **ultra-fast variometer**
  - **Real-time wind measurement**
  - **Air-density** measurement
  - automatic **3D high precision compass calibration**r
  - Worldwide automatic adaption to the local **magnetic induction parameters** using NOAA data
  - Connectivity via **CAN, Bluetooth or WLAN, RS232 and USB**

<!--  -->
Software-In-The-Loop (**SIL**)-Simulator to test and qualify algorithms

Some more details about the features can be found under [algorithms](https://github.com/larus-breeze/sw_sensor_algorithms).

The sensor unit can also be used as a universal data logger for manned or UAV test flights with a sampling-rate of 100 Hz. The logger writes it's data to a micro-sd with a virtually unlimited capacity. The **Larus avionics system** is connected via a **CAN bus**.
