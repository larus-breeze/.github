## Larus Flight Information Sensor System for Gliders

This project provides hardware and software to create a **Sensor System** for **Glider Flight-Management-Systems** like [XCsoar](https://github.com/XCSoar).

Sensor hardware containing an **IMU**, **pressure sensors** and a **(D-)GNSS**

Sensor firmware providing information for glider navigation like 

  - **position**, 
  - attitude and heading **AHRS**, 
  - GNSS/INS-based ultra-fast **variometer**, 
  - real-time **wind measurement**, 
  - **air-density** measurement 

  and much more.

Software-In-The-Loop (**SIL**)-Simulator to test and qualify algorithms 

Experimentally: Additional sensors like Angle-Of-Attack or meteorological data
